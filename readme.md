
Node.js is an open source server environment. It runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
 It uses JavaScript on the server. It uses asynchronous programming.
It eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request. It runs single-threaded, non-blocking, 
asynchronous programming, which is very memory efficient.
